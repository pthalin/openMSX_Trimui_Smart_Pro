### How to install
IMPORTANT: You must have [Crossmix OS](https://github.com/cizia64/CrossMix-OS) installed to use openMSX. Save yourself some headache by using a branded SDCARD of good quality and not the noname card that you may get when buying the device.

Extract the openMSX release archive in the "Emus" folder on the SDCARD. Run the "EmuCleaner" App after installation.

### How to use
Select a game in the MSX or MSX2 category and press the X button. This brings up a menu where you can select diffrent configurations.

NOTE: For the game [Pampas & Selene](https://www.unepicfran.com/en/msx_pampas.html) use "openMsx (C-Bios MSX2+)" with the file "pampas_e.rom" to automatically apply the needed configuration.

NOTE: Running Turbo R requires system roms to be installed. These will be automatically downloaded the first time you run Turbo R if you are connected to wifi.

You need Linux to build.  
Install the [patched SDK](https://github.com/pthalin/SDK_Trimui_Smart_Pro)
